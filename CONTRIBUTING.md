# We have a few simple rules while making a new PR.

## Code style

#### Try to stick with our code style. Browse files, and you will know what we actually mean. Keep in mind that we don't use '*' imports.

#### The indentation we use is 4 spaces, and we use the LF end of file.

#### Don't include folders included in .gitignore file.

## Naming

#### Pull requests should be named like that:

`GH-{NUMBER} Title of PR`

Please don't include troll, racist and sexual names. We are a mature project.

## Building

#### You can build EternalCombatLog using `shadowJar` Gradle task or `./gradlew shadowJar` command in GitBash.

#### Output file will be located at `build/libs`
